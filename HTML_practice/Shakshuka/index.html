        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <a name="patty" />We get the patty and we throw a bunch of seasonings on it. then the fun part is when we melt a stick
        of butter on it
        then we saute and frape the other thing to do the thing. And don't forget the other most unforgetable part!! OMG what am
        I saying!?@<br><br>
        <a name="lettuce" />This is the part where we put some green into this friggn burger to make it moterately healthy. But
        don't fret, this may
        be the only part that is remotely healthy at all.. (but wait, there's tomato isn't there? damn.. oh well).<br><br>
        <a name="tomato" />Oh tomato, and tomAtos and my toes are all toes and who even carres these days to be honest really?
        Anyway, we're all asking way too many damn questions when we really should be more concerned with what is standing right
        in front of us. But wait! there's more!! Lets talk about the tomatooooooeeeesssss!!! Wel I forgot to do at this part so
        I'm shutting up now.<br><br>
        <a name="onion" />Hello goodnight and goodbye. There's something about being awake at the wee hours in the mornin. And
        top of the morrow to all of yas and onions make me cry and if they don't make you cry you are not a real person...
        Die<br><br>
        <a name="mayo" />Mayo is white but so is the white house and why is it the white house anyway. Why can't it be the black
        house or the brown house. What is wt with white people and always tryna take all of our stuff. Can we please be more
        sensitive to the MAYO!!<br><br>
        <a name="ketchup" />This kethcup can be red at times but there are other times where it comes off as other colors. You
        ever just eat a packet of ketchup, it is terribly awesome. Give me more. OK, I'm done.

<!-- HTML Forms
Now it's time to add a form for reviews.

N.B. Remember that forms make a request upon submission to the provided action URI. Since we don't have a server to
handle the request, our form won't really do anything on submission. Still, this exercise will help practice coding the
structure of our form element.

Make a section element before your footer and after the directions section
Create a form element in the section
Inside the form element make a label and text input for the name of the reviewer. Use the 'for' and 'id' attributes to
link the label to the input.
Create a label for "Rating" and 5 radio inputs with corresponding value attributes. Have the radio buttons default to
checking '1'.
Create a "Cooking Expertise" label that corresponds to a select element containing 5 option elements, don't forget their
value attributes:
Select Cooking Expertise (make this disabled and selected by default)
Sometimes Cook
Cook Everyday
Cooking is a Hobby
Professional Chef
Code a label element for "Review" but this time place the corresponding textarea element inside the label element
instead of using for/id. -->
